REMAINING CONSIDERATIONS - ALL RESOLVED
===============================================

UPDATE (January 2026)
=====================

- Consent-gated non-essential third-party content (e.g., embeds/fonts) so third-party requests are not made until the user opts in.

- Added client-side spam/format validation (honeypot + cooldown + strict field checks) before allowing Suggestions submissions.
