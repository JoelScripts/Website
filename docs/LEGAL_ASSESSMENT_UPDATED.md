**Flying With Joel Website**  
**Last Updated:** January 23, 2026  
**After Critical Items Added**

---

## Current Status: 🟢 MUCH IMPROVED

**What you've now added:**
✅ Flight Simulation Disclaimer  
✅ Affiliate Link Disclosure (best-effort disclosure guidance)  
✅ Liability Limitation  

**Current Risk Level:** 🟡 LOW-MEDIUM (Down from MODERATE)

---

## Remaining Important Gaps

### PRIORITY 1: Business & Tax Reality Check ⚠️

**This is critical - not legal, but personal safety:**

#### Question: Are you earning money?
```
☐ Twitch subscriptions/donations
☐ Affiliate commissions
☐ Sponsorships
☐ Ad revenue
☐ Selling products
```

**If YES to any of the above:**
```
⚠️ YOU LIKELY NEED TO:
1. Register as self-employed/freelancer
2. File income taxes
3. Keep financial records
4. Pay appropriate taxes

Country Examples:
- UK: Self-employed registration with HMRC
- USA: Report as self-employment income (Schedule C)
- EU: Register with local tax authority
- Canada: Report on personal tax return

⚠️ RISK: Very HIGH if not done
Not having business registration/tax filings can result in:
- Back taxes + penalties + interest
- Legal action by tax authorities
- Business shutdown orders
- Criminal charges (in extreme cases)

ACTION: Consult accountant IMMEDIATELY if earning money
```

---

### PRIORITY 2: Copyright & Music Rights ⚠️

**If you stream or post videos with music:**

#### Check Your Content
```
Question: Do your streams/videos include music?

If YES:
⚠️ What type of music?

1. Royalty-Free Music ✅
   - Licensed for streaming (Twitch/YouTube typically allow)
   - Examples: Epidemic Sound, AudioJungle, FreePik
   - ACTION: Keep licenses/proof

2. Licensed Music ✅
   - You paid for licensing rights
   - ACTION: Keep receipt and keep license current

3. Copyrighted Music (Your Own) ✅
   - You own the copyright
   - ACTION: Keep proof of ownership

4. Copyrighted Music (Others') ❌ PROBLEM
   - No license or permission
   - RISK: Copyright strikes, channel suspension, legal action
   - ACTION: REMOVE immediately and replace

5. YouTube Audio Library ✅
   - Built-in royalty-free library
   - Safe to use on YouTube
   - May not be safe on other platforms
```

**Status Check:**
```
☐ All music in streams is royalty-free OR
☐ All music is properly licensed OR
☐ All music is my own copyright

If none of above:
⚠️ COPYRIGHT RISK: HIGH - Fix immediately
```

---

### PRIORITY 3: Content Platform Compliance ⚠️

**You must follow Twitch AND YouTube rules if you stream there:**

#### Twitch Compliance
```
✅ You likely need:
- Twitch Terms of Service acknowledgment
- Content rating (Mature/Not Mature)
- Proper copyright music/no DMCA strikes
- No hate speech or harassment
- Appropriate behavior guidelines

Your website needs:
☐ Link to your Twitch terms (already have)
☐ Disclaimer that Twitch policies apply
☐ No promise of content you can't deliver

Currently missing:
- Explicit acknowledgment users must follow Twitch ToS
```

#### YouTube Compliance (if you post)
```
✅ If uploading videos:
- Copyright claims handled by YouTube
- Ads may be affected by copyright
- Community guidelines apply
- Age-restricted content possible

Your website needs:
☐ Link to your YouTube channel (have)
☐ Disclaimer about YouTube policies
☐ Note about copyright claims on videos
```

---

### PRIORITY 4: Content Rating & Age Guidance ⚠️

**Important if viewers include minors:**

#### Current Status
```
Missing: Explicit age/content rating for your website

Question: Is your content appropriate for all ages?
Or does it contain mature themes like:
☐ Strong language/swearing
☐ Adult humor
☐ Violence (even in games)
☐ Sexual content
☐ Hateful content
```

#### What You Need
```
If ALL ages appropriate:
"This website is suitable for all ages."

If mature content possible:
"This website may contain mature content including:
- [Your specific content types]

Parental guidance recommended for viewers under 13.

This website complies with COPPA (Children's Online
Privacy Protection Act). We do not knowingly collect
data from children under 13."
```

**Where to add:** Homepage, About page, Terms

---

### PRIORITY 5: Email & Contact Information ⚠️

**Current Issue I spotted:**

```
Your Terms say: flywithjoeluk@gmail.com
But your Privacy Policy says: flywithjoeluk@gmail.com

✅ Good: They match

⚠️ Check if this is correct email
- Is this monitored?
- Will you see data requests?
- Is it secure?

ACTION: Verify this is the email you actually use
```

---

### PRIORITY 6: Data Request Readiness ⚠️

**Current Status:**

You have:
✅ Privacy Policy explaining rights
✅ Data access procedure guide (in docs)
✅ Contact email provided

Missing from WEBSITE:
- Explicit instructions on HOW to request data
- Timeframe for response (you have 30 days)
- What format data will be provided in

**Should add to Privacy Policy or FAQ:**
```
"To request your personal data:

1. Email flywithjoeluk@gmail.com with subject:
   'Data Access Request'

2. Include:
   - Your full name
   - Email address used on our site
   - What data you're requesting

3. We will respond within 30 days

4. Data will be provided in portable format
   (PDF or plain text)"
```

---

### PRIORITY 7: Specific Legal Situations ⚠️

**Check if any of these apply to you:**

#### Situation A: Selling Physical Products
```
If you sell:
☐ Merchandise
☐ Digital products
☐ Physical goods

You need:
- Returns policy
- Refund policy
- Shipping policy
- Consumer protection disclosures
- Payment processor terms
```

#### Situation B: Collecting Personal Information
```
Current: Contact form only

If you add:
☐ Email newsletter
☐ User accounts
☐ Community forum
☐ Comments section

You need:
- GDPR compliance for that data
- Clear privacy disclosures
- Opt-out mechanisms
- Data deletion procedures
```

#### Situation C: Sponsorships or Partnerships
```
If you receive:
☐ Free products from companies
☐ Money for mentions
☐ Exclusive deals

You need:
- Disclosure of sponsored content
- FTC #ad hashtag compliance
- Clear separation of opinions
- Honest reviews only

Currently: You disclose affiliate links ✅
Need to check: Sponsored products disclosure
```

#### Situation D: Under 18 or Minor Status
```
If you are under 18:

⚠️ Many legal documents require adult status
Your Terms may not be fully enforceable
Additional parental consent may be needed

ACTION: If under 18, consult parent/guardian
and legal professional before operating website
```

## What Still Needs Attention (Ranked by Importance)

### CRITICAL - Do Within 1 Week
```
1. ⚠️ TAX/BUSINESS STATUS
   If earning ANY money, you may need to register and/or file taxes
   Consult: Accountant/Tax Professional
   Risk: VERY HIGH if not done
   
2. ⚠️ VERIFY COPYRIGHT MUSIC
   Check all streams/videos
   Remove any unauthorized music
   Risk: HIGH (copyright strikes)
```

### IMPORTANT - Do Within 1 Month
```
3. ⚠️ Add Content Rating to Website
   State if content for all ages
   Add COPPA notice if needed
   Risk: MEDIUM (regulatory)
   
4. ⚠️ Add Data Request Instructions

### RECOMMENDED - Do When Convenient
```
5. 🟡 Add Governing Law (for UK)
   Clarify jurisdiction
   Risk: LOW (already implied)
   
6. 🟡 Add Accessibility Statement

7. 🟡 Add Business Information

```

---

## Your Remaining Vulnerabilities

### Highest Risk: TAX/BUSINESS
```
If you earned ANY money from:
- Twitch subs/bits/donations
- Affiliate commissions
- Sponsorships
- Any monetization

⚠️ You likely owe taxes
⚠️ You may need business registration
⚠️ Risk: Penalties, fines, investigation

ACTION: Contact accountant THIS WEEK
```

### High Risk: COPYRIGHT MUSIC
```
If streams/videos have unlicensed music:
- YouTube: Will get copyright claims
- Twitch: May get DMCA strikes
- Website: Could face legal action

ACTION: Check all content for music
ACTION: Remove or license anything questionable
```

### Medium Risk: CONTENT RATING
```
If not clear if content is for all ages:
- COPPA violations possible
- FTC could investigate
- Harder to defend

ACTION: Add clear content rating
```

### Medium Risk: PLATFORM COMPLIANCE
```
Twitch/YouTube have strict rules:
- Content policy violations
- Copyright strikes
- Account suspension

ACTION: Read and follow platform rules
ACTION: Link to platform policies
```

### Low Risk: REMAINING ITEMS
```
- Accessibility statement: Low priority
- Governing law: Already covered
- Business info: Nice to have
- Contact instructions: Already have email
```

✅ Privacy Policy: flywithjoeluk@gmail.com

ACTION: Make sure this email is:
☐ Active and monitored
☐ Secure (2FA enabled)
